Shock departure

Mr Altman's sacking was announced in an unassuming OpenAI press release.

Coming just weeks after he'd represented the firm at the UK's AI Safety Summit, and days after appearing at the company's first conference for third-party developers, the timing was a shock.

The board was said to have "lost confidence" in him due to unspecified communications issues.

In this case, the board had meant just four people - including OpenAI's chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who had reportedly become concerned that Altman was prioritising company growth over AI safety.

Members five and six - Mr Altman himself and then-president Greg Brockman - opposed it but were outvoted.

"I loved my time at OpenAI," Mr Altman posted on X as the news broke, describing it as "transformative".

"Will have more to say about what's next later."

Mr Altman was reportedly keen on the idea of returning. His brother Jack, also a start-up CEO, of HR firm Lattice, warned his detractors they were "betting against the wrong guy".

But by Sunday, Mr Altman and Mr Brockman had joined OpenAI investor Microsoft to lead an AI research team.

Bloomberg reported the tech giant's CEO Satya Nadella was "furious" and blindsided about the ousting.

OpenAI responded by hiring Emmett Shear, the former boss of streaming site Twitch, as Mr Altman's replacement.

But the sense of panic at OpenAI was obvious, as more than 500 employees signed a letter threatening to quit.

Nothing encapsulated the chaos more than Mr Sutskever signing, saying he "deeply regrets" the board's decision.
